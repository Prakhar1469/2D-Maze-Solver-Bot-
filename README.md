# 2D-Maze-Solver-Bot-
Designed and built an autonomous robot that follows black-line paths and solves mazes using IR sensors and the left-hand rule.  – Used three IR sensors to detect path segments and programmed turning logic based on sensor patterns.  – Implemented left-turn priority (left-hand rule) to ensure complete maze traversal.  – Controlled two DC motors via Arduino Uno using PWM for fixed-speed movement and delay-based turning.  – Winner of MazeUp event at Techspardha 2024 at NIT Kurukshetra.  – Tools & Tech: Arduino Uno, Embedded C, IR Sensors, Arduino IDE
